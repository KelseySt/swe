This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Alumni Feature
Due to budget constraints, to run the Alumni feature, a local proxy server must be run for alumni backend functionality. If you'd like to test the feature run these commands:

```
npm install
npm run proxy
```
When you log in with Google, make sure to go to the User Profile page and add a college affiliation (e.g., "University of California", "University of Georgia")
The live deployment can be found [here](https://swe-rosy.vercel.app/)


If you would like to run the entire project locally:
1. clone the repository
2. add the api keys found near the end of the Project Plan to a .env or .env.local file
2. follow these commands in your terminal in the project directory:

```
npm install
npm run proxy
# OPEN NEW TERMINAL WINDOW
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
